**Evaluation metrics**Â are used to measure the quality of the model. One of the most important topics in machine learning is how to evaluate your model. When you build your model, it is very crucial to measure how accurately it predicts your expected outcome.

Let's start with some definitions:

`Confusion Matrix`: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classifier by showing the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. It is useful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a classifier, and also provides information about the distribution of errors made by the classifier:

| True Label \ Predicted Label | Positive | Negative |     |     |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------- | --- | --- |
| Positive                     | TP       | FN       |     |     |
| Negative                     | FP       | TN       |     |     |
