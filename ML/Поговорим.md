Linear space - A mathematical structure is a set of elements called vectors, for which the operations of addition with each other and multiplication by a number are defined - a scalar

In every linear space, there are several principal vectors called the basis. All other vectors can be expressed through these basis vectors. A basis is a minimal set of vectors such that:
1) None of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others;
2) Every element of the space can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of a finite set of vectors from this set.

Определитель — числовая характеристика матрицы, которая в определенном смысле описывает сжатие или расширение пространства при её преобразовании.
