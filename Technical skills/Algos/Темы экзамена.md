The main topics of test questions : 
1. Programming basics (data types, control constructs, loops, functions, OOP basics, use of standard libraries) 
2. Using sets and dictionaries
3. Sorting by counting, sorting by merging, quick sorting 
4. Greedy algorithm (application for sorted sequences, determination of the sorting parameter) 
5. Ordinal statistics (search for O(n), properties of the median of the array, definition of k the largest numbers for O(n), the median in the sliding window) 
6. Stacks, queues, decks 
7. Two pointers 
8. Prefix sums 
9. Binary search 
10. Using balanced binary search trees 
11. Dynamic programming (dynamic programming with one and two parameters, editorial distance, DP by substrings) 
12. Width-first traversal of graph 1
13. Depth-first traversal of graph (connectivity components, the presence of cycles, coloring in two colors, topological sorting)
